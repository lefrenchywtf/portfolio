                HistoRecall is a 2 players platform fighter made with the SFML API using C++.
                It is the first group project I participated at Creajeux. Its main gamemode is an inspiration of Nidohgg’s gamemode, in which you have to kill your opponent to be able to move from a screen sized map
                to another.

I also created the inputs save, load and modify systems, to be able to have custom input mapping, for keyboard and controller.</div>
            <div class="body-text">As a team, we also had to face some changes in the production. With two departures, we had reduce the game’s scope, but also optimize our workflow. So we decided to, every morning, sumup our objectives for the day and share our eventual difficulties and discuss about it. That led to a good group cohesion and ended up delivering a very fun game that we are all proud of.</div>
