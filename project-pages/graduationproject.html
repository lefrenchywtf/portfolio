                Using Battlefield V and The Finals as my main inspirations, I have been able to properly fracture a simple building and destroy it by shooting at it.
                I am also able to localize areas of the building that will destroy a bigger area when a part of it is destroyed, which will be
                useful when destroying fundations of the building. I'm also able to trigger the destruction of a section of a building that doesn’t have enough
                support to stand (like a roof not having enough support underneath it)

                This project was very interesting because it helped me learning new things about Unreal, but also using a feature that was not
                documented much, since it's a new public feature (you had to access the engine's source code before). Even if I couldn't finish the project the way
                I planned at the start (Struggles with Chaos and redesigning the main system to be the most reliable and cleanest possible), I'm still very happy and proud
                of the work I delivered, and I also learned quite some from the struggle.
