                During its production, I have worked most of the time on the environement, how some items and props could be interacted with, like for example some destructible stage borders that will extend the stage size throught the round, or also some objects that can be thrown and will break on impact. I used the Chaos destruction system for this effect.
                I also worked on the animation blueprint to implement the characters' animations and I was also making sure the artists had their work implemented to the game (for example VFXs) and taking the time to adjust and test things with them.
            </div>
          <div class="body-text">Finally near the end of the project, I made the character selection menu, working with two controllers simultaneously, with characters dynamically spawning and moving
            to a set position, facing each other. At first, I wasn't planning on manager two controllers at the same time, but the artists wanted an interface that pretty much forced that system
            to exist, and it was a little challenge to deliver it on time considering Unreal doesn't use multiple controllers for UI natively.</div>

                  <img src="../assets/images/IMAGE_NAME" class="gallery-image">

              - To add an image to the this area, copy one of the above, paste it below this comment, and change the following:
                  - IMAGE_NAME: the name of the image file in assets/images
                  - IMAGE_CAPTION: to the caption of the image
